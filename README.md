## 💼 Business Use Model

Replic8 is also used by freelancers and operators who deploy the system for local businesses and charge recurring monthly service fees.

The model typically includes:

1. Introducing the system to a business  
2. Allowing the business to test it  
3. Demonstrating value through booked appointments  
4. Transitioning to a monthly service arrangement

## 🌎 Why It Matters

Appointment-driven businesses depend heavily on responsiveness. Missed calls and slow follow-ups often result in lost revenue. AI closing systems aim to reduce that gap by automating early-stage customer interactions.

Replic8 represents a growing category of AI tools focused on operational efficiency rather than creative automation.
